Castro  promised democracy
From 1956-1959 Castro Rebels against US supported Batista regime

Companies appealed to the government for help
Bay of Pigs
March 1960, CIA trained Cuban exiles for a Cuban invasion
Attempt to  put an end to Castro’s regime
Kennedy approved it on CIA assurances of victory. 
April 17, 1961, US military and Cuban exiles were planning on attacking Cuba at the Bay of Pigs
This was a failed mission- Poor execution and no popular support!
There was supposed to be a second landing site but it never arrived
When the main group landed there were 25,000 Cuban troops waiting. 
Many exiles were killed the rest were imprisoned
One of Kennedy’s biggest embarrassments while in office
