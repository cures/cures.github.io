Bearing 2048 is doable. In fact, it isn't as hard as you probably think it is. Here are a few tips, which shouldnt be too hard to follow and win with:
1. Never swipe up. This will help with the next step.
2. Swipe left, right, and down, and focus on concentrationg your largest number on the bottom right corner of the 2048 grid.

3. Build "chains" where the line gains in number from left to right, so your largest number is always in the bottom right corner.
4. Wheneve you collapse this bottom row (so that a square or two opens up) swipe down rather than be forced to swipe left so you keep the largest number in the bottom right corner.

Good luck- you can do it!
